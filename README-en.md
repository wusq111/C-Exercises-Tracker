# C Language Exercises Tracker

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document various exercises encountered during the study of C programming, especially those that highlight understanding or usage issues. By recording and solving these exercises, this repository aims to reinforce foundational knowledge of C language. Additionally, it will serve as a resource for creating a future C language guidebook with comprehensive exercise examples.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on topics and difficulty levels, making it easier to manage and locate exercises systematically:
