# C-Exercises-Tracker

Welcome to the **C-Exercises-Tracker** repository! This repository is dedicated to managing and documenting the C language exercises I encounter throughout my learning journey. Covering a range of topics from basics to advanced, this repository aims to systematically organize exercises and errors, record solution approaches, and facilitate review and practice.

## Repository Structure

The folders and files are organized by topic and difficulty level, making it easy to navigate and review:

## Documentation Format

Each `.md` file includes detailed documentation of related exercises, covering error records, solution code, and problem-solving approaches. Below is a template for documenting an exercise:

### Exercise Template

```markdown
# Exercise Title

## Problem Description
Briefly describe the problem requirements and input/output format.

## Error Analysis
Record encountered error code and analyze the cause.

## Correct Solution
```c
// Correct C code
```

## Solution Approach
Explain the steps and thought process involved in solving the problem.

## Improvement & Optimization
If thereâ€™s a better solution or code optimization, document it here.

## Review Tag
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Review Date: 2024-01-01
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Add New Exercises**: For each new exercise, add it to the corresponding `.md` file under the appropriate folder, making sure to document the problem, error analysis, correct solution, and approach.
2. **Record Errors**: When errors are encountered, document the code and reasons for errors for future review.
3. **Regular Review**: Use the review tags to regularly revisit difficult problems and error-prone areas to strengthen your understanding.
